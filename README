Creates a cache of html files from url requests. If it receives a url it already has downloaded, will return the locally cached file. Handy for scraping websites.

USAGE:
you first initialize the cache with a path to a folder to store the responses

rc = RequestCache.new("caches/patent_pages")

Then you initiate a response with
rc.get("http://www.shancarter.com")
